# Scope

## Short Description
Scope: how deep is the program?

## Long Description
Scope measures the depth of the program within the organization. The deeper the champion program embeds itself, the more significant the impact it can have on the organization.

## Overview

| Level | Name | Validation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Maturity 0 | Developers only | Survey the Champion population, and ask for current role.
| Maturity 1 | Product adjacent (SCRUM, SRE, DevOps, Cloud) | Survey the Champion population, and ask for current role.
| Maturity 2 | Product managers | Survey the Champion population, and ask for current role.
| Maturity 3 | Executives and Managers | Survey the Champion population, and ask for current role.

## Maturity 0 - Developers only

The traditional champion program focuses on the developers. However, developers have the most significant impact through their participation in a program, as they design and implement the products and applications, execute the tools, and take action based on tool results.

### Activity
* Create program activities that have value for developers.
  
### Benefit
* Developers are the center and are a great start.

## Maturity 1 - Product adjacent

Product adjacent includes all those folks that have visibility and influence over the products and applications. For example, product adjacent includes SCRUM leadership, Site Reliability Engineers (SRE), DevOps, Cloud, and Quality Assurance(QA).

### Activity
* Create program activities that have value for the product adjacent.

### Benefit
* Expanding to the product adjacent lowers security friction across the business.

## Maturity 2 - Product Managers

Product managers create the vision and set priorities for additions to products and applications. When product managers catch a security vision, they prevent security friction and enable the proper security prioritization.

### Activity
* Create program activities that have value for product managers.

### Benefit
* Product drives what engineering builds and can drastically lower security friction by specifying built-in security.

## Maturity 3 - Executives and Managers

Executives and managers have ownership of champion resources. Building a true partnership with this user group protects champions from pushback on their champion activities.

Executives and managers are busy, so having a quarterly approach to meeting with this group can provide the right amount of value while not being a drain.

### Activity
* Create program activities that have value for executives and managers.

### Benefit
* When the leaders share best practices, the entire culture has changed.
