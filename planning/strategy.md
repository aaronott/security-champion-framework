# Strategy

## Short Description
Strategy answers the questions, "What do you want them to do?" and "What is the big-picture goal?"

## Long Description
The Strategy sets the tone for your Security Champions program, identifying the shared vision and goals for participants. Participants want to know where the program is heading and how they can be a part of the solution. Providing this guidance motivates Security Champions to do their best within the program.

## Overview

## Maturity 2 - Yearly goals, program vision, and an acceptance and tracking tool.

### Activity
* Define and publicize yearly goals.
* Define and prioritize a program vision. 
* Provide an acceptance and tracking tool for the Champion and Manager goals.

### Benefit
* Yearly goals and opt-ins protect the Champion's resource commitments. Most of the time, Champions perform their security duties with a shared slice of their time. By setting yearly goals and facilitating an opt-in where Champions and the Manager acknowledge the signup, you prevent uncomfortable conversations. Things can be difficult if the Champion and manager are not in sync regarding resources.
* Represent how security champions are business enablers and partner with a strong Executive Sponsor that catches the Champion program vision.

### Examples
* Participate in the Security Champion community via monthly meetings.
* Drive the adoption of our SDL.
* Attain a specific security education level.
* Focus on growing expertise in one area of our SDL (Security Controls, Threat Modeling, Static Analysis, Vulnerability Testing)

## Maturity 3 - Executive Sponsor buy-in.

### Activity
* Achieve Executive Sponsor buy-in for program vision.

### Benefit
* When an Executive Sponsor is on board with the Champions program, they can assist with spreading awareness within the Executive Suite and help with any dedicated budget required to execute the program.
