# Education

## Short Description
Education: how will you train the community at scale?

## Long Description
Security education is the approach, tools, and techniques to educate security champions about the most critical pieces of security.

Security education consists of different modalities. The two most popular approaches are online security education platforms and in-person classroom training. Both of these modalities have their advantages and disadvantages. Platforms provide a solution to impact a large percentage of the Champions, no matter their global distribution. Classroom training provides a personal touch, with closer instruction on the finer points, but is expensive to provide for a large organization, both in resource time and cost.

## Overview

| Level | Name | Validation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Maturity 0 | No Security Education. | Nothing to validate.
| Maturity 1 | Ad hoc security training. | Review training plans and feedback.
| Maturity 2 | Regular training. | Review training plans and feedback.
| Maturity 3 | Creative training. | Review training plans and feedback; interview a cross-section of those trained.

## Maturity 0 - No security education.
No security education for Champions.

### Activity
* Start an education program for your champions.
  
### Benefit
* Security education lays a foundation for a strong security champion. When the champion learns the essential pieces of security, from fundamentals to deep dives to secure coding, they design and implement more secure applications.

## Maturity 1 - Ad hoc security training
Ad hoc security training occurs with no regular schedule. For example, this training could be a short webinar on the OWASP Top 10, a classroom session, or a pointer to an online course. The point of ad hoc is that no regular schedule applies to the champions.

### Activity
* Scope an ad hoc training, find a teacher, and advertise it to your champions.
* Execute the training. 

### Benefit
* Some training is occurring, but we arenâ€™t catching everyone. There is a baseline set for all champions.

## Maturity 2 - Regular training
Regular security training for all champions sets the baseline of knowledge for all.

### Activity
* Evaluate various training offerings, and choose a solution that fits your budget and will touch all the developers.
* Choose a training offering and build a programmatic approach to roll it out.
* Generate metrics for training completion, per Champion.

### Benefit
* Spreading education across the community provides base levels of knowledge and experience.

## Maturity 3 - Creative training
Creative training goes beyond regular, utilizing techniques such as Hack-a-thons and build/break/fix contests.

### Activity
* Brainstorm creative ideas throughout the year that are creative and beyond your regular training.

### Benefit
* Collaborative experiences allow champions to learn from each other.
